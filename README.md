The Tic-Tac-Toe web app, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, lets users play against each other or an AI. It tracks moves, checks winning conditions, and ensures smooth gameplay. With an interactive UI, players aim to get three in a row to win. This project highlights key web development skills and provides an engaging experience.
